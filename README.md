# Pandas-Visualize
A small tool to have interactive control over the visualization of pandas DataFrames within an IPython Notebook. 
Using the widgets framework, you can select the columns and rows to visualize. Which can be useful to explore lage DataFrames. 

It monkey-patches a pandas DataFrames with a new `iview()' method that creates the visualization.
